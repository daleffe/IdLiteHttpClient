# IdLiteHttpClient

A very simple HTTP (not HTTPS) client using Indy that allows you to make requests, basic authentication and send raw text data (including in GET requests, like POST/PUT/PATCH).

Several functions of a conventional HTTP client (such as Indy HTTP, ICS OverByte, etc) aren't present (such as cookies, custom headers, digest authentication and others).

Developed using Delphi 2007 and Indy 10.1.5.
